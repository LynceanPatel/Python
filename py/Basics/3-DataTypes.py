#3-DataTypes
''' The data stored in memory can be of many types. For example, a
person's age is stored as a numeric value and his or her address is
stored as alphanumeric characters. Python has various standard data
types that are used to define the operations possible on them and the
storage method for each of them.

Python has five standard data types −

Numbers

String

List

Tuple

Dictionary

#Python Numbers
'''
Python supports four different numerical types −

int (signed integers)

float (floating point real values)

complex (complex numbers)

All integers in Python3 are represented as long integers. Hence there is no separate number type as long.

number1 =10
print("Number:",number1)

#You can also delete the reference to a number object by using the del statement.
del number1

# TO hold the result on command prompt
input("Press <<Enter>> to exit.")
